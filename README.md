# Play Kasparov

A project I created back in 2013 when I was first getting acquainted with the wonderful language of javascript.  It was a 'single page chess app' in which you play Gary Kasparov.  As the game swings in favour of either the human player or the AI, sound clips are played to reflect the emotional state of AI Kasparov.  This project used to select moves using a REST api that exposed a C++ AI engine that I coded prior to this app, but for the sake of practicality is now using a client side library for AI (http://forwardcoding.com/projects/chess/chess.html).
